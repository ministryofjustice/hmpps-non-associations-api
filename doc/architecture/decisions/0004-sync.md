## Status

Accepted

## Context

This document will cover the approach for the non-associations service to "own" non-associations data and synchronisation this information back into NOMIS

### Migration plan for Non-Associations - Moving data off NOMIS approach
A two-way sync and migration pattern is to be adopted.

Therefore, the approach will be to :-
- Keep NOMIS up to date with changes made in Non-Associations service
- Provide a two-way sync and keep both systems in synchronisation so that turning off access to old NOMIS screens can be done prison by prison
- Migrate all the data from NOMIS
- Once all prisons had been switched over - turn off NOMIS -> DPS sync (now 1 way only)
- All access to screen removed

Steps taken:
The Non-Associations Team.
- Model the Non-Associations data in a new database 
- Build API functionality for managing the data 
- Provide Non-Associations endpoint in NS API that mirrors data in NOMIS
- Build screens to make use of the new API
- Raise events on creation or amendments of Non-Associationss
- Build a "sync" and "migrate" endpoints to allow NOMIS to send Non-Associations data

On NOMIS (syscon)
- Call Non-Associations "sync" endpoint when any updates where made to Non-Associations data in NOMIS
- Listen to events when Non-Associations where created in DPS and store them in NOMIS
- Migrate all the data held on Non-Associations in NOMIS by calling Non-Associations "migrate" endpoint
- Reconcile mismatches with weekly checks
- Remove all Non-Associations endpoints in prison-api once all services are using new Non-Associations API

Data is still held in NOMIS and will be maintained for reporting purposes.

### NOMIS synchronisation sequence
When a change is made to Non-Associations either a creation or update, events are be fired. The sequence of events for syncing back to NOMIS is shown below:

```mermaid

    actor Prison Staff
    participant Non Associations UI
    participant Manage Non Associations API
    participant Non Associations Database
    participant Domain Events
    participant HMPPS Prisoner to NOMIS update
    participant HMPPS NOMIS Prisoner API
    participant NOMIS DB

    Prison Staff ->> Non-Associations UI: Maintain Non-Associations
    
    Non-Associations UI ->> Manage Non-Associations API: Call API with changes
    activate Manage Non-Associations API
    Manage Non-Associations API->>Non-Associations Database: update DB
    Manage Non-Associations API->>Domain Events: domain event raised
    Note over Manage Non-Associations API,Domain Events: prisoner.non-association.[created/amended]
    Manage Non-Associations API-->>Non-Associations UI: Saved Non-Associations returned
    deactivate Manage Non-Associations API
    
    Domain Events-->>HMPPS Prisoner to NOMIS update: Receives prisoner.non-Association domain event
    activate HMPPS Prisoner to NOMIS update
    HMPPS Prisoner to NOMIS update->>HMPPS NOMIS Prisoner API: Update NOMIS with Non-Associations data
    HMPPS NOMIS Prisoner API ->> NOMIS DB: Persist data into the Non-Associations tables
    deactivate HMPPS Prisoner to NOMIS update

```

## Key components and their flow for Non-Associations sync
```mermaid
    
graph TB
    X((Prison Staff)) --> A
    A[Non-Associations UI] -- Maintain Non-Associations --> B
    B[Non-Associations API] -- Store Non-Associations --> D[[Non-Associations DB]]
    B -- Non-Associations Updated Event --> C[[Domain Events]]
    C -- Listen to events --> E[HMPPS Prisoner to NOMIS update]
    E -- Update NOMIS via API --> F[HMPPS NOMIS Prisoner API]
    F -- persist --> G[[NOMIS DB]]
    R[HMPPS Prisoner from NOMIS Migration] -- perform migration --> B
    R -- record history --> H[[History Record DB]]
    K[HMPPS NOMIS Mapping Service] --> Q[[Mapping DB]]
    R -- check for existing mapping --> K
    R -- 1. find out how many to migrate, 2 Non-Associations details --> F
```


#### Domain Event Types:
In all instances the domain event will contain the unique reference to the Non-Associations.
- prisoner.non-associations.created 
- prisoner.non-associations.amended

**Example:**
```json
{
  "eventType": "prisoner.non-associations.amended",
  "occurredAt": "2023-03-14T10:00:00",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Non-Associations added",
  "additionalInformation": {
    "prisonerNumber": "A1234AB"
  }
}
```


## API endpoints for sync

### Sync endpoint 
This endpoint will return all the Non-Associations information needed to populate NOMIS

`GET /non-associations/{prisonerNumber}`
```json
{
  "prisonerNumber": "A9109UD",
  "nonAssociations": [
    {
      "reasonCode": "VIC",
      "typeCode": "WING",
      "effectiveDate": "2021-07-05T10:35:17",
      "expiryDate": "2021-07-05T10:35:17",
      "authorisedBy": "Staff Name",
      "comments": "Do not location near",
      "prisonerNonAssociation": {
        "prisonerNumber": "A0135GA",
        "reasonCode": "PER"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Sync endpoint
This endpoint will contain all the information need to populate the Non-Associations database with an Non-Associations related offender data changed in NOMIS

`POST /sync`
```json
{
  "prisonerNumber": "A9109UD",
  "nonAssociations": [
    {
      "reasonCode": "VIC",
      "typeCode": "WING",
      "effectiveDate": "2021-07-05T10:35:17",
      "expiryDate": "2021-07-05T10:35:17",
      "authorisedBy": "Staff Name",
      "comments": "Do not location near",
      "prisonerNonAssociation": {
        "prisonerNumber": "A0135GA",
        "reasonCode": "PER"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Migration endpoint
This endpoint will contain all the information need to populate the Non-Associations database with an Non-Associations related offender data

`POST /migrate`
```json
{
  "prisonerNumber": "A9109UD",
  "nonAssociations": [
    {
      "reasonCode": "VIC",
      "typeCode": "WING",
      "effectiveDate": "2021-07-05T10:35:17",
      "expiryDate": "2021-07-05T10:35:17",
      "authorisedBy": "Staff Name",
      "comments": "Do not location near",
      "prisonerNonAssociation": {
        "prisonerNumber": "A0135GA",
        "reasonCode": "PER"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```



## Decision
- Migration process will be trialed in pre-prod and UAT testing will be needed to check mappings have accurately represented historical data
- NOMIS screens can be turned off once all non-associations screens are complete and staff are informed to switch over.
